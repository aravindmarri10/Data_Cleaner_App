Streamlit-based app for basic data cleaning

# Cleaner - Data Cleaning Assistant

This is a beginner-friendly Streamlit app I created while learning data cleaning as part of my AlmaBetter course.

I got curious after seeing some AI-based data cleaning tools, and thought why not try building something of my own. I had no idea where to start, but after learning about Streamlit, I realized I could build a UI easily without HTML or CSS.

I built this app using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and NumPy. ChatGPT helped me understand Streamlit components one by one, and I slowly kept adding new features to the app.

## Features

- Upload CSV file
- Preview rows, columns, info, and summary
- Remove duplicate rows
- Drop unwanted columns
- Show null percentage
- Drop rows or columns with nulls
- Fill missing values (numerical and categorical)
- Reset to original data
- Download cleaned file

## How to Run

##  Install required libraries  
Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy
```

##  Run the app

```bash
streamlit run your_app_filename.py
```
